# AI.JSX React App Demo

This is a demo using [AI.JSX](https://ai-jsx.com) to create an AI-powered React app.
Here, all of the React and AI.JSX code are running on the browser client, though it is
also possible to use React server-side rendering to run the AI.JSX code on the server.

A live, deployed version of this demo is at https://ai-jsx-create-react-app-demo.vercel.app/.

For more details, see [the AI.JSX+UI Guide](https://docs.ai-jsx.com/guides/ai-ui) on docs.ai-jsx.com.
