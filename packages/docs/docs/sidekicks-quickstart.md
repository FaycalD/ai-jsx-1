# Quickstart: Fixie Sidekicks

This is a quickstart guide to building a Fixie Sidekick. A sidekick is...TODO.

:::info What You Will Do
At the end of this quickstart you will:

1. **Be Up & Running** â†’ Prereq's installed, accounts set-up, demo Sidekick up and running.
1. **Be Ready to Customize** â†’ Take the demo code and start customizing it for a custom Sidekick.
1. **Feel Amazing** â†’ You will feel so good you might try attempting a jumping, flying sidekick.\*

\*_Consult your medical and/or physical fitness professional first. Do not attempt in tight pants._
:::

## Step 0: Prerequisites

:::warning Prerequisites
Before you get started, you will need to have a free Fixie developer account and have some tools installed on your machine. If you don't want to fuss with installing things on your machine, you can sign-up for a free DevZero account and use the pre-configured template for Fixie Sidekicks.
:::

### Sign-up for Fixie

We will use [Fixie](https://fixie.ai) for hosting our Sidekick. Sign-up for a free Fixie developer account:

1. Go to [todo link](https://beta.fixie.ai).
1. Create an account using either a Google or GitHub account.
1. Navigate to your [profile page](https://beta.fixie.ai/profile) TODO insert image. Keep this page open as we will come back to this in Step 2 to grab our API key which is required for deployment.

### Install Node.js

:::tip On Windows? Use WSL.
If you are using a Windows machine, we highly recommend using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for development with Node.js. This is optional. If you want to use WSL, follow [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl) which will get you set-up with WSL, Node, and VSCode.
:::

TODO

### Install Visual Studio Code

If you already have a great text editor that you love, or you followed the above guide for setting up a Windows machine, skip this step.

TODO

### Install the GitHub CLI (optional)

GitHub provides a nice CLI that simplifies many aspects of working with code on GitHub. If you already really strong git-fu or you'd rather just copy down a .zip of the template code, skip this step.

TODO

## Step 1: Get Sidekick Template Code

We are going to start with some demo code. There are a few ways to get it (below). Put the code somewhere easy to find. For example, something like `Documents\GitHub\fixie-sidekick-template` or `Documents\fixie-sidekick-template`.

#### Method 1: Clone via GitHub CLI

TODO

#### Method 2: Clone via Git CLI

TODO

#### Method 3: Clone via GitHub Desktop

TODO

#### Method 4: Download Code as .zip Archive

TODO

While you're here, give us a star.

## Step 2: Build and Deploy Sidekick

OK. Set-up is out of the way. Now is when we really start moving!

### Open Project in VS Code

Open Visual Studio Code (or your favorite text editor). Open the folder where you saved the template code (e.g. `Documents\GitHub\fixie-sidekick-template`)

### Populate Fixie API Key

Go back to the web page we left open above when signing up for a Fixie account. If you can't find it, it's [here](https://beta.fixie.ai/profile).

- Click on the TODO icon and copy your API key.
- The key looks something like `FmEEMtjcHLfNGPrLhRQwQfwG9Li...` and is 175 characters long.

Back in your text editor, open the file named `.env`. Add your key:

```javascript
FIXIE_API_KEY = YOUR_KEY_HERE;
```

This should look something like this:

```javascript
FIXIE_API_KEY=FmEEMtjcHLfNGPrLhRQwQfwG9Li...[continues]
```

### Deploy Sidekick to Fixie

The moment of truth has arrived! Let's deploy our sidekick to Fixie!

From your terminal:

```terminal
FIXIE_API_URL='[https://beta.fixie.ai](https://beta.fixie.ai/)' npx @fixieai/fixie deploy
```

TODO is the URL still needed?

Deploying takes up to a couple of minutes. While deployment is running you will see status messages in your terminal. For example, if our Fixie user is "sarah" and she is deploying a sidekick named "sidekick-acme", then we would expect to see something like this:

```terminal
sarah@computer % FIXIE_API_URL='https://beta.fixie.ai' npx @fixieai/fixie deploy
ðŸ¦Š Deploying agent sarah/sidekick-acme...
ðŸ‘½ Updating agent sarah/sidekick-acme...
```

Once complete deployment completes, we would expect to see something like this:

```terminal
sarah@computer % FIXIE_API_URL='https://beta.fixie.ai' npx @fixieai/fixie deploy
ðŸ¦Š Deploying agent sarah/sidekick-acme...
ðŸ‘½ Updating agent sarah/sidekick-acme...
âœ” Revision a9b5e04c was deployed to https://beta.fixie.ai/agents/sarah/sidekick-acme
```

#### Troubleshooting: Verify the Sidekick Builds

If the above deploy step failed for some reason, it is a good idea to build our sidekick locally to see if there are any errors raised. Building is done from the terminal:

```terminal
yarn build
```

TODO Is this still needed? Make sure that you add public: true to the agent.yaml file and use the 1.0.13 version of fixieai/fixie to deploy.

## Step 3: Test Sidekick

We've got our Sidekick deployed. Let's test it out to see what it can do! We are going to test the sidekick using four different methods.

### Method 1: Via curl

First up, let's ask our Sidekick a question using curl. From your terminal:

```bash
curl POST http://beta.fixie.ai/api/conversations/<your agent handle> \
    -d '{"message": "what can you do"}' \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' -vvv
```

This should display something like this:

TODO

### Method 2: Via the Fixie Dashboard

### Method 3: Via a Standalone Web App

### Method 4: Via Embedding in Another Web App

TODO could we just include a simple web page in the template code that can be served up locally?

## Step 4: Profit

TODO more examples, where to focus efforts for customization (system prompt, tools, etc.)

<!--

1. Create a new package
2. Implement your Sidekick.
3. Deploy your Sidekick
4. Talk to your Sidekick using any of the following:
    1. Visit https://beta.fixie.ai/agents and select your agent from the list
    2. Visit https://fixie.vercel.app/embed/<your agent handle>
        1. e.g. https://fixie.vercel.app/embed/peter/sidekick-github
        2. note: <your agent handle> has your username included

# Sidekick component

See [the implementation](https://github.com/fixie-ai/ai-jsx/blob/3f97b9bd030c15c65892ce8bdb409874e3487d13/packages/ai-jsx/src/batteries/sidekick/platform/sidekick.tsx) and type definitions in ai-jsx.

## Prop: `tools`

Pass an object of functions. The Sidekick component will wrap those functions to add observability for you.

## System Message

Use props `systemMessage` and `finalSystemMessageBeforeResponse` to set a custom system message. These will be mixed in with some light [default system messages](https://github.com/fixie-ai/ai-jsx/blob/3f97b9bd030c15c65892ce8bdb409874e3487d13/packages/ai-jsx/src/batteries/sidekick/platform/system-message.tsx).

`finalSystemMessageBeforeResponse` exists because we found that it was a good place to put important instructions the model otherwise wouldnâ€™t attend to. (In particular, getting the model to actually use the gen UI components.) Default to omitting this prop â€“ only pass it if you have a specific need to do so.

## GenUI

When using the Fixie-provided frontends, we support GenGenUI but not DomSpecGenUI (Domain-Specific Generated UI; e.g. Help Scout making a custom component to render a conversation.)

The built-in GenGenUI components are `Card`, `Citation`, and `NextStepsButton`.

If youâ€™re using the Fixie-provided frontend, you can use the  the `userProvidedGenUIUsageExamples` prop can be used to give more guidance on how to use the built-in GenGenUI components, but you probably wonâ€™t need to do this.

If you want DomSpecGenUI, you need to Bring Your Own Frontend, which is probably technically possible but not something weâ€™ve put effort into supporting at the moment. If you were going down this path, youâ€™d use the props `userProvidedGenUIComponentNames` and `userProvidedGenUIUsageExamples` to tell the Sidekick about your custom components.

## DocsQA

Thereâ€™s no special abstraction for calling a corpus; itâ€™s just a `tool` like any other. See [Sidekick Help Scout for an example](https://github.com/fixie-ai/sidekick-helpscout/blob/35a140c26219ecf83cc7c95665073c01c614f871/app/api/chat/userland/tools.tsx#L105-L144).

# Caveats

- [The first message from the Sidekick will be blank.](https://fixie-ai.slack.com/archives/C05J75EFZ6X/p1693966240387299?thread_ts=1693957933.804079&cid=C05J75EFZ6X)
- Thereâ€™s no good local dev flow. When you make a change locally, you have to run `fixie deploy` to test it. Ask @Peter Salas for a better approach if this is annoying. ðŸ˜„
