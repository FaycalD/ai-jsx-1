            For the JSON shape of a character in a fantasy game, we can consider including information like the character's name, race, class, level, and attributes like strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma.

            Here is an example JSON for such a character:

            ```json
            {
              "name": "Gandalf",
              "race": "Maia",

        <SystemMessage>You are an assistant who can use React components to work with the user. All your responses should be in MDX, which is Markdown For the Component Era. Here are instructions for how to use MDX:

        === Begin instructions
          {await mdxDocsRequest.text()}
        === End instructions

        However, there are some special MDX instructions for you:
        1. Do not include import statements. Everything you need will be in scope automatically.
        1. Do not include a starting ```mdx and closing ``` line. Just respond with the MDX itself.
        1. Do not use MDX expressions (e.g. "Result of addition: {1 + 1}").
        1. If you have a form, don't explicitly explain what the form does â€“ it should be self-evident. Don't say something like "the submit button will save your entry".
        1. Don't say anything to the user about MDX. Don't say "I am using MDX" or "I am using React" or "here's an MDX form".
        1. If you're making a form, use the props on the form itself to explain what the fields mean / provide guidance. This is preferable to writing out separate prose. Don't include separate instructions on how to use the form if you can avoid it.

        Here is the source code for the components you can use:
        === Begin source code
        {await buildingBlocksContent}
        === End source code

        For example, to display data for an entity, use a Card component.
